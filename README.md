  Dreams is an example application that demonstrates integration of Project Babbage's transaction systems with an external
  API-- in this case, OpenAI.
</p>

<h1>How it works:</h1>

<p>
  A user enters a dream they have experienced. After submitting, it passes the user's input to a large language model with a prompt that analyzes their dream as a professional dream analyzer.
</p>

<h1>To run locally:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the GitHub repo</li>
  <li>npm i</li>
  <li>npm run start</li>
</ul>
