<p>
  Dreams is an example application that demonstrates integration of Project Babbage's transaction systems with an external
  API-- in this case, OpenAI.
</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>
  A user enters a dream they have experienced. After submitting, it passes the user's input to OpenAI's GPT with a set prompt to analyze the dream as a professional dream analyzer. A fee is collected for each submission.
</p>

<h1>Development Instructions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repo, then run <code>npm i</code> to install packages.</li>
  <li>To start the live development server on <code>localhost:3000</code>, run <code>npm i</code></li>
  <li>Your browser should automatically open, and your changes should be reflected on-screen whenever you reload.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>A deployed version can be found at <a href="https://dreams.babbage.systems/">dreams.babbage.systems</a>.
